# Notes
-The hardware design can be found in the .xpr format for edit through the Vivado platform and also in the .xsa format ready to be opened in Vitis for software implementation.
-The project was done specifically for the Zybo-Z7 board but is compatible with any board based on the Zynq arhitecture that has the same componentes used from this specific board.
